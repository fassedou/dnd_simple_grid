# Simple grid for D&D

A single javascript file. Just download it and open it with your browser. An internet connection is not required to use. Everything is on this .html file.

It's a simple grid for a D&D, this is what you can do on it :
- Add characters with simple data you can modify afterward
- Move a character (you can see the distance, in cm)
- You can add prebuild character
- You can add in large numbers prebuild monsters
- You can change the settings of the grid (size, dimension...)
- You can decorate the grid by filling some cases with color (to create obstacles, walls...)
- There is a basic dice simulator
- English and french available
- You can save everything to a json string and retrieve all your data later by putting this string

I did this project for me because Roll20 is great but way more complex that what I needed, so I created a very basic version of a grid (what I needed). I put this project on github because I thought maybe someone will have the same needs.
